# React Boilerplate

## Run Instructions

- Fork repo
- Change App.js intial render as desired
- Clone contents of fork into desired new repo
- Clone new repo to machine
- In new repo run `npm install`
- In new repo run `npm start`


## Requirements
Your app should make use of React
Your repo tracker should have an input for users to give their GitHub username
After submitting their username, use the GitHub API to retrieve that user's list of repos
When selecting a repo, a User should be shown some data about that repo eg. issue count, stargazers, forks etc.
NB: This usage of the GitHub API does not require authentication

## future feautures
links on each list point -> give information about the repo as a list beneath
styling -> add fonts, bg, style search bar and button
